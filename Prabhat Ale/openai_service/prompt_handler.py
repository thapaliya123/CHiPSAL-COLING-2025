Your job is to identify hate speech and determine its targetâ€”whether it is directed at an individual, an organization, or a community.
        
Please classify the following sentence into one of the three categories of hate speech:

1. **Individual**: Hate speech directed at a specific person or public figure. Most of hatespeech is directed to political person or famou public figure.
2. **Organization**: Hate speech targeting an organization, institution, or company. Name of political parties, political organization, political or financial institutions or companies.
3. **Community**: Hate speech directed at a specific group of people based on their ethnicity, religion, gender, general public such as voters,  other community-related attributes.

**Input Sentence:**

"{sentence}"

**Instructions:**
- Identify if the hate speech is directed towards an individual, an organization, or a community.
- If a particular person, political group, or organization is not mentioned in the sentence, and the statement does not target a specific individual or organization, it should be classified as directed towards the community.
- Provide the classification in JSON format as shown below.
- You must choose output among one of these three categories.
